          <p class="examples__prj-content">Having undergone extensive renovation and restoration work, which was completed in 2014, the Grossmarkthalle now houses the more public areas of the ECB, such as the lobby, exhibition areas and cafeteria, as well as a visitor centre, staff restaurant and conference area. The latter have been integrated into the hall as separate buildings on the basis of a “house-in-house” concept.</p>

          <h2 class="examples__prj-heading">High-rise</h2>
          <p class="examples__prj-content">The high-rise houses the vast majority of the ECB’s workplaces and internal meeting rooms. The large council meeting room and offices of members of the ECB’s decision-making bodies are located on the upper floors. Each floor offers a high level of flexibility to allow for a variety of office configurations.</p>
